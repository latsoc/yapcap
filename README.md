## What it does

YapCap lives in your COSMIC panel and shows how much of your AI coding quota you've used — without sending anything to a third party. All data is fetched directly from provider APIs using accounts you add in YapCap. No telemetry, no cloud sync, no separate account needed.

## Highlights

- 🤖 **Providers**
    - **Codex** — 5h/weekly windows, usage credits, and banked reset availability
    - **Claude** — session/weekly/extra usage
    - **Cursor** — total, Auto/Composer, and API usage
    - **Antigravity** — grouped Gemini and Claude/GPT model quota (5h + weekly)
    - **Gemini** — Pro / Flash / Lite quota bars (OAuth accounts only)
    - **GitHub Copilot** — Free chat/completions, paid premium interactions, or credits and spend for token-based billing
    - **Minimax** — API key usage tracking
    - **Z.AI Coding Plan** — global personal quota with 5-hour, weekly, and optional MCP windows
    - **Kimi for Coding** — API key usage tracking with weekly and rate-limit windows
    - **OpenCode Go** — API key usage tracking with 5-hour, weekly, and monthly windows
    - **OpenRouter** — account credits and spent balance via an explicitly added API key
    - **Grok** — subscription usage shown as a weekly window + available prepaid credits
- 👥 **Multi-account support** — add, switch, and remove accounts per provider. The popup pages through stored accounts one at a time; independent panel switches can show all enabled providers and all their accounts side by side. With “Show all accounts” on, each displayed account is refreshed.
- 🔎 **Automatic discovery** — detected providers appear automatically, provider availability updates live, and an empty setup opens Manage providers. Gemini remains opt-in and must be enabled manually.
- 🔐 **In-app login** — guided browser login for Codex, Claude, Antigravity, Gemini, Copilot, and Grok; API-key forms for Minimax, Z.AI, Kimi, OpenCode Go, and OpenRouter; Cursor scans the local IDE state.
- 🔑 **OpenCode integration** — compatible keys can optionally prefill Minimax, Z.AI, Kimi, OpenCode Go, and OpenRouter forms; Codex and Copilot offer explicit OAuth imports. Credentials are copied only after confirmation and are never synchronized with OpenCode.
- ✅ **Active badge** — matches the host account for Codex, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, OpenCode Go, and Grok. Minimax and Kimi only mark legacy environment-source accounts when the corresponding environment key is present. Copilot, Antigravity, and Z.AI have no host Active badge.
- ⚙️ **Configurable panel** — logo+bars, bars only, logo+%, or %-only; optional all-provider and all-account display, percent/amount/both, panel text size, used/left toggle, and relative or absolute reset times.
- 🔔 **Codex banked resets** — show available resets separately for each account, notify once when a new reset appears, and offer an explicit two-step, account-specific redemption flow.

## Install

### COSMIC Store (recommended)

Install **YapCap** from the COSMIC Store and receive automatic updates. 

If you prefer the command line and have the COSMIC Flatpak remote configured:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists --user cosmic https://apt.pop-os.org/cosmic/cosmic.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user cosmic io.github.TopiCsarno.YapCap
```

### apt (Debian/Ubuntu/Pop!\_OS)

```bash
sudo apt install ./yapcap_*.deb
```

### rpm (Fedora/openSUSE)

```bash
sudo rpm -i ./yapcap_*.rpm
```

Download packages from the [latest release](https://github.com/TopiCsarno/yapcap/releases/latest).

### From source

Requires COSMIC development dependencies, a Rust toolchain, and `just`. The [CI workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) lists the system packages used for Ubuntu builds. `just install` installs under `~/.local` and adds YapCap to the panel configuration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TopiCsarno/yapcap
cd yapcap
just install
```

## Quickstart

1. After installing, go to COSMIC Settings app → Desktop → Panel → Configure panel applets
2. Add **YapCap** from the panel applet picker.
3. Click the panel button to open the popup. Detected providers appear automatically, except Gemini, which must be enabled manually.
4. Open **Manage providers** (the header's list icon) to enable any provider, including one that was not detected. Return to the popup and select its provider tab; use the arrow controls to reach tabs beyond the six visible slots.
5. Use the provider's setup action to add its first account. Once connected, **Manage accounts** on the account card opens account settings; the card's arrows switch between saved accounts.

## Accounts

Each provider supports multiple accounts. Select its popup tab and open **Manage accounts** on the account card, or use the setup action when no account has been added yet.

- **Add account** — starts Codex, Claude, Antigravity, Gemini, or Grok browser OAuth, GitHub Copilot device login, Minimax/Z.AI/Kimi/OpenCode Go API-key entry, or Cursor IDE scanning. Claude asks you to paste the browser's authorization code back into YapCap. Grok also offers explicit import from the Grok CLI.
- **Switch account** — select an account row or use the account card's arrows; the panel and popup follow that selection. This does not switch the host tool's account or its Active badge.
- **Remove account** — deletes only YapCap's copy of the credentials. Provider accounts and host app configs are never touched.

Codex, Claude, Cursor, Antigravity, and Gemini keep at most one account per provider identity. Copilot keeps at most one account per GitHub numeric user id and displays the current GitHub username. Minimax, Z.AI, Kimi, OpenCode Go, and OpenRouter use unique user-provided labels and reject duplicate API keys.

### Codex banked resets

Banked resets are **not** the same as purchased Codex usage credits or the automatic weekly reset. They are one-time benefits that may expire; [OpenAI explains their effect and eligibility](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/20001498-how-banked-codex-resets-work). YapCap reads availability for each configured Codex account from `GET /backend-api/wham/rate-limit-reset-credits`. In the Codex account detail, it shows the number available and the earliest expiry. When a new credit appears, a desktop notification is sent once per account and credit; the deduplication record is kept privately in that account's storage. Native desktop notifications require `notify-send`.

To use one, open that account in YapCap and choose **Use a reset…**. YapCap fetches the availability again, selects the credit expiring soonest, and shows the account, expiry, and a **second confirmation**. Only **Yes, use one reset** sends `POST /backend-api/wham/rate-limit-reset-credits/consume` with a unique idempotency key. A successful reset can change the weekly reset date. The success page returns automatically to the account after three seconds; **Done** returns immediately. A failed response never claims success, and a retry within the dialog reuses the same request key. No reset is consumed just by opening the applet, checking availability, or opening the confirmation.

The reset endpoints are part of the Codex backend and may change. The app never logs raw reset IDs or OAuth tokens; it stores only hashed credit fingerprints for notification deduplication. This redemption flow was verified with synthetic HTTP responses and manually with one real credit; the test suite does not consume credits.

### OpenRouter

Enable **OpenRouter** in Manage providers and add a management API key through the account form. YapCap reads account totals from `GET https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/credits` and, when that response is unavailable, attempts the per-key `/api/v1/key` endpoint. Account credit totals and spend are distinct from Codex banked resets. The key is stored privately under the YapCap account state directory; OpenCode's `openrouter` API credential may be used as a one-time prefill. No OpenRouter key or private profile is shipped with YapCap.

### Grok

Sign in through the browser or explicitly import credentials from `~/.grok/auth.json`. Restore repeats that import for an existing account. YapCap stores its own credential copy under `<state-root>/yapcap/grok-accounts/<id>/` and refreshes managed tokens without writing back to the CLI. An imported access token without a refresh token eventually requires sign-in or another import. Detection uses the `.grok` directory/auth-file marker; it does not sign you in automatically.

Grok accounts and the host Active badge match by provider user ID, falling back to normalized email. Team metadata is stored but is not a separate account-identity key.

Usage comes from `https://cli-chat-proxy.grok.com/v1/billing?format=credits`. The parser prefers the shared subscription `creditUsagePercent`, falls back to the `GrokBuild` product percentage, and uses zero when neither is present. It labels the window **Weekly**, assumes a seven-day duration, and uses `currentPeriod.end` when supplied. These are the current parser's assumptions, not independently verified quota guarantees. Positive prepaid balances appear as available credits; parsed on-demand cap/usage data is not rendered as a Grok extra-usage meter.

### Z.AI Coding Plan

Enable **Z.AI Coding Plan** in **Manage providers**, select its popup tab, and enter
an API key through the account setup action. YapCap stores only non-secret account metadata in COSMIC
configuration; the key belongs to the YapCap-managed account directory under
`<state-root>/yapcap/zai-accounts/<id>/api_key.txt`.

When adding or reauthenticating, YapCap may prefill a usable typed API key from
OpenCode's local `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`, checking `zai-coding-plan`
before `zai`. This is a
one-time read-only prefill: YapCap never writes to or synchronizes with
OpenCode, and it has no environment-key fallback. A key is stored locally after
save without remote validation.

Automatic Z.AI detection is content-aware: a usable typed API entry at either
OpenCode key is required; a bare auth file, malformed entry, or non-API entry is
not treated as detected.

YapCap reads the global personal Coding Plan quota from the fixed endpoint
`https://api.z.ai/api/monitor/usage/quota/limit`. The primary request uses
`Bearer <key>` and only a 401 receives one raw-key retry; 5xx responses are not
retried with raw authorization. Usage is shown as **5 Hour**, **Weekly**, and
optional **MCP** windows in that order. MCP has its own label and no assumed
calendar duration. An MCP-only response is valid, but the UI reports Coding
Plan usage as unavailable rather than fabricating token or weekly usage. OAuth,
alternate endpoints or hosts, region/team/promotional scopes, and fixed monthly
duration are not supported.

## Panel styles

Configured under **Settings** (the header's gear icon):

| Style | What's shown |
| --- | --- |
| Logo + bars | Provider icon and one or two compact usage bars (default) |
| Bars only | One or two usage bars, no icon |
| Logo + percent | Provider icon and the primary panel window as a percentage |
| Percent only | Primary panel window as a percentage only |

The panel normally uses the first two windows. Claude shows Weekly first and Session second; Cursor shows Total plus API usage; Antigravity uses the first two five-hour model-group windows when available. Without accounts on any enabled provider, the panel shows the YapCap icon.

## Display options

Also under **Settings**:

- **Usage format** — show quota as *used* (how much you've consumed) or *left* (how much remains).
- **Panel value** — percent, monetary amount, or both. Providers without monetary data fall back to percent.
- **Show all providers / Show all accounts** — independent switches: each visible account uses the selected panel style; when showing all accounts, each account is refreshed individually.
- **Panel text size** — adjustable from 8 to 24.
- **Reset time format** — relative durations (`Resets in 2d 4h`) or absolute local times (`Resets Wednesday at 8:25 AM`).
- **Auto-refresh interval** — how often YapCap polls the provider APIs in the background.

Popup usage bars include a pace indicator when the window has a duration and a future reset time: a vertical marker shows expected usage for the elapsed portion of the window so you can see at a glance whether you're running ahead or behind.

## Updates

YapCap checks GitHub for a new release on startup, retrying failed checks with backoff. If one is available, a red dot appears on the **About** info icon and a link to the release page appears on the **About** page. No automatic download or install.

The Flatpak build updates automatically through the COSMIC Store.

## Privacy

YapCap stores provider credentials under YapCap-owned account storage and calls provider APIs directly over HTTPS. Claude OAuth refresh uses Anthropic’s token endpoint. Codex login uses YapCap's own browser OAuth flow and loopback callback; it does not launch the Codex CLI. Release checks contact GitHub's API. Logs should never contain credentials, bearer tokens, or cookie values — if you find one leaking, please file a bug.

## File locations

**Native** (typical XDG defaults):

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.config/cosmic/io.github.TopiCsarno.YapCap/v600/` | Settings (provider toggles, accounts, display options) |
| `~/.cache/yapcap/snapshots.json` | Former cached usage state; current builds leave it on disk but do not load it |
| `~/.local/state/yapcap/<provider>-accounts/` | Managed credential copies (`<provider>` is one of `codex`, `claude`, `cursor`, `antigravity`, `gemini`, `copilot`, `minimax`, `zai`, `kimi`, `opencode-go`, `openrouter`, `grok`) |
| `~/.local/state/yapcap/codex-accounts/<id>/reset-notifications.json` | Private per-account banked-reset notification history and latest available count; no tokens or raw reset IDs |
| `~/.local/state/yapcap/logs/yapcap.log.YYYY-MM-DD` | Daily log output |

**Flatpak** (`io.github.TopiCsarno.YapCap`): YapCap account state and logs live only under `~/.var/app/io.github.TopiCsarno.YapCap/data/yapcap/`. Old Flatpak snapshot caches under `~/.var/app/io.github.TopiCsarno.YapCap/cache/yapcap/` may remain on disk but are no longer active runtime state. The manifest mounts host `~/.config/cosmic` read-write for COSMIC app settings (not `xdg-config/cosmic`, for compatibility with Flatpak path resolution).

## Limitations

- COSMIC only. No GNOME, KDE, or tray fallback.
- **No Active badge for Copilot, Antigravity, or Z.AI.** These adapters do not
  implement host-active-account detection. Selecting an account in YapCap does
  not establish which account an external tool is using.
- **Gemini OAuth only.** Add a Gemini account through YapCap's Google browser
  login. API-key and Vertex AI usage are not metered by this integration;
  YapCap's managed login is independent of the gemini-cli authentication mode.
- **One Gemini project per account.** YapCap uses the `cloudaicompanionProject`
  returned by Google's `loadCodeAssist`, or a `gen-lang-client` project found
  through Cloud Resource Manager when that field is absent. It does not display
  all GCP projects or offer a project picker.
- **Kimi uses API keys.** Add a Kimi for Coding account with its API key; an
  optional one-time prefill can come from OpenCode's local `auth.json`, but the
  file is never read during usage refresh.
